# Steampunk Salesforce Interview

Welcome to Steampunk's Salesforce Interview prescreen! As part of the technical evaluation process for Salesforce candidates at Steampunk, you will be asked to utilize the codebase within this repository to answer questions posed by Steampunk interviewers.

## Logistics

As part of the technical prescreen, please be prepared to:

- Have your video and audio on during the teams meeting
- Share the screen of the computer you are using during the teams meeting
  - You must share the desktop, choosing to only share a given window is not acceptable
- Prepare to introduce yourself in under a minute. This interview round will be judged solely on your answers to technical questions, and it is in your best interest to leave as much time as possible to get to them.

## Preparation

In order to prepare for the technical prescreen, please perform the following steps.

Please note, these steps also demonstrate the baseline level of technical knowledge that is expected at Steampunk. The recruiting team and Steampunk interviewers will not provide any guidance or clarifications concerning the below steps.
